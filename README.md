This is the Japanese language to Armenian language words translations repositroy.

Currently, Dekiru Nihongo Shokyuu 5 sections words list is trasnlated and converted into json files.

I planned to have various words and expressions translations into Armenian, then to prepare json files for later usage in various applications.

The preparation of dataset is planned as follows:
 - The 1st phase - have a words translations from 3 books of Dekiru Nihongo lesson books (until 2022 December).
 - The 2nd phase - have a words translations from Minna no Nihongo, Shinkanzen, and some other popular books if possible (during 2023). 
 - The 3rd phase - have Taishukan Japanese Readers fairy tales books from 0 to 5th level by findin words from 1&2 and adding remaining words translations (until 2023 December).

Finally, to merge all the dataset and import in Takoboto, or Jisho.org or make Anki flashcards (for time beeing).
